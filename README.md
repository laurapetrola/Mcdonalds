# McDonald's Nutritional Analysis Project

## Introduction

This project is part of my journey to learn more about **Python for data analysis and data cleaning**. As someone who is passionate about nutrition and loves eating at McDonald's (especially the McChicken!), I decided to dive into the nutritional facts of McDonald's menu items. The goal is to analyze the data, identify patterns, and create insights to better understand the nutritional value of the food I enjoy.

By working on this project, I aim to:
- Practice data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Explore data visualization techniques.
- Build interactive dashboards to make the data more accessible.
- Create a health score metric to classify menu items as "Healthy" or "Unhealthy."

## Project Overview

The project focuses on analyzing McDonald's nutritional data, which includes information such as:
- **Calories**
- **Total Fat**
- **Sodium**
- **Carbohydrates**
- **Dietary Fiber**
- **Protein**
- **Vitamins and Minerals (% Daily Value)**

The analysis is divided into several steps:
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values.
   - Normalizing data for fair comparison across different nutritional criteria.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Identifying the most and least healthy items.
   - Comparing categories (e.g., burgers, desserts, drinks).

3. **Health Score Calculation:**
   - Creating a custom health score based on nutritional criteria.
   - Classifying items as "Healthy" or "Unhealthy."

4. **Interactive Visualizations:**
   - Building interactive dashboards to explore the data.
   - Allowing users to filter by category, calorie range, and more.

5. **Nutritional Insights:**
   - Highlighting why certain items are classified as unhealthy (e.g., high calories, fat, or sodium).

## Technologies and Libraries Used

### Python Libraries
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**: For static data visualizations.
- **Plotly**: For interactive visualizations.
- **Dash**: For building interactive web-based dashboards.

### Key Features of the Libraries
- **Pandas**: Used to load, clean, and preprocess the dataset. It also helps in calculating the health score and classifying items.
- **Seaborn/Matplotlib**: Used to create static charts like bar plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
- **Plotly**: Used to create interactive charts that allow users to explore the data dynamically.
- **Dash**: Used to build a web-based dashboard where users can filter and visualize the data.
